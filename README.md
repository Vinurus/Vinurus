##  IT Student | Paramedic | Professional Sailor

Hi! I’m an IT student passionate about **Java development**, **mobile apps**, and **embedded systems**.  
I enjoy creating projects from scratch — from small simulations to functional Android applications.

###  What I’m learning right now
- Java (OOP, simulations, small games, backend basics)  
- Android Studio (UI, activities, interval timers)  
- Basics of C for microcontrollers  
- Building simple electronic devices (PCB + firmware)

###  Projects on GitHub
I’m currently uploading and polishing my student projects:

Be sure to check out our academic RPG game — a collaborative project with a simple but fully playable GUI:

    👉  https://github.com/Console-dungeon/console_dungeon
    
- 🧩 **Java RPG Game** — object-oriented game mechanics  
- 🅿️ **Parking Simulation** — generators, models, business logic  
- ⏱ **Android Interval Timer** — simple yet functional mobile app  
- 🔌 **Microcontroller mini-projects** (in progress)

###  Goals
- Get a programming internship (Java / Android / Embedded)  
- Improve code quality and architecture  
- Build more real-world projects

If you want to collaborate — feel free to reach out! 😊
